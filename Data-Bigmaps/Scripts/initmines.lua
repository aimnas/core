*************    
** Remarks **
*************

The purpose of this Lua script is to provide the code and data needed to
initialize the strategic mines. There are two reasons for the game to make
calls to this script:

	1. The strategic layer gets initialized.
	   Right after a new game is started, the program calls InitializeMines to
	   gather the data defining the mines (see §1.). It then uses that data to
	   actually create the mines.
	
	2. The player enters a mine sector.
	   When a mine sector gets loaded (tactical mode), the program calls
	   InitializeHeadMiners to collect information on creation of head miners
	   and how to distribute them among the mines (see §2.).

    function InitializeMines()
    
    Gets called on initialization of strategic layer.

    This function is supposed to return an array table of initialization data
    for each mine. Every element itself must be a table consisting of the
    following members:
    
    - Location (required)
      String, defining the sector to place the mine, e.g. "A10".
    
    - Type
      Use MineType.Gold or MineType.Silver (cp. §0.).
    
    - MaxRemovalRate
      Amount of income to be gained at each production period ( = 1/4 of
      daily income).
      
    - RemainingOreSupply
      Total amount of money available to be extracted.
    
    - Infectible (0/1)
      Boolean, specifying whether or not a mine can be infected by crepitus.
      This is kind of a hack until creature quest becomes externalized.
      Do not set this to 1 for mines other than Drassen, Alma, Cambria, Grumm.
    
    - AssociatedUnderground
      Array table of strings specifying sector coordinates, e.g. "A10-1".
      This relates underground sectors to the mine. In these sectors the game
      adds miners working underground, and also uses that information to build
      the sector name.

    function InitializeHeadMiners(mines, currentMine)

    This function is called when the player enters a mine sector.
    
    It can return either nil or the head miners initialization and
    distribution. If it returns nil, it will be called again when a mine
    sector gets loaded. If it returns a value other than nil, it will not be
    called again.
    
    Parameters:

    - mines
      An array of tables featuring only the following member:
      - MaxRemovalRate
    
    - currentMine
      This is the index of the mine being entered by the player (cp. §1.1.).
    
    If the function does not return nil but the head miners distribution, it
    must return an array of tables consisting of the following members:
    
    - Profile
      The profile ID of the head miner.
    
    - Quotes
      Array of exactly four integers defining the quote IDs of the head miner
      for the following strategic events:
      1. RUNNING_OUT
      2. CREATURES_ATTACK
      3. CREATURES_GONE
      4. CREATURES_AGAIN
      It is valid to insert -1 for missing quotes.
    
    - MineID
      The index of the mine the head miner is assigned to (cp. §1.1.).
