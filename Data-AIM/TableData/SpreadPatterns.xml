<SPREADPATTERN>
	Defines the pattern.
	Can have 1 <NAME>, 1 <xpsread>, 1 <yspread>, 1 <method>, and any number of <p>
<NAME>
	The Name used by other XML files.
	Case insensitive, leading and trailing spaces are trimmed on load.
	No actual naming convention is specified, but I use full UpperCamelCase and put Spread at the end of every name.
<DESC>
	Description, for informative purposes only.
	Not used in game at all.
<p>
	Defines a specific pellet angle.  Must have 1 <x> and 1 <y>
<x>
	Defines a pellet angle's horizontal deviation from a Mer'c line of sight.
	Similar to yaw, but not the same.
	Can be negative, positive, or zero.
<y>
	As <x> but vertical.
	Similar to pitch, but not the same.
<xspread>
	Defines a spread range's horizontal range for randomized pellets.  Negative numbers will be made positive on load.
	Any pellets fired in the range could fall anwhere between -xspread and +xspread.
	Keep in mind that since this defines maximum spread, normal distribution will cause most pellets to land closer to the center, so the group may be tighter than you expect.
	If both xspread and yspread are zero, then they are ignored.
<yspread>
	As <xspread> but vertical.
<method>
	The distribution method to use for a random spread.
	These are pretty self explanitory.  Think of it this way: if you fired the shotgun at the side of a barn from 10 meters, this is the rough shape the pellets would make on it.
	Can be one of:
		Rectangle
		Diamond
		Ellipse
	If left unspecified, the pattern will default to the value of giSpreadPatternMethod_Default, which is Ellipse.
	This default value may be moved to the INI file in the future.

The first spread pattern defined here is the default used if no other pattern is specified in other XML files.
Sections are commented below, and initial arrangement is organized, but this is not necesary for the code.
Any number of SPREADPATTERN tags can exist in any order... but clarity is nice to have.

If specific pellet angles are defined (e.g. <p><x> 0.0000</x><y> 0.0000</y></p> )  then they will be used first, in the order they are listed.
If more pellet angles are defined than the number of pellets an AmmoType fires, then the excess angles are ignored.
If an AmmoType has more shots than the number of angles that are defined, and there no spread ranges defined, then the pellet angles are recycled.
E.g. if 9 pellet angles are defined, no xspread or yspread, then pellet 10 will follow angle 0, 11 will follow 1, etc.
(pellets angles are created as arrays on load, so if nine pellet angles are defined the first is index 0 and the last is index 8)

If an AmmoType has more shots than the number of angles that are defined, and there are spread ranges defined, then the excess pellets will fire at random angles within the spread.
E.g. 9 pellet angles defined, xspread=0.032 and yspread=0.032 then the first nine pellets follow the defined angles, and all remaining pellets fired will be at random angles between -0.032 and +0.032

If no pellet angles are defined, and spread are defined, then all pellets will fire at random angles within the defined range.
In order for the spread to be used, one value must be non-zero.  If both are zero, it is ignored.

All angles (for individual pellet angles and random spread) are defined in radians.
Traditional shotgun chokes are talked about in how much spread they have on paper at a particular range.
For example, 10inch spread at 20 yards, or 25cm at 20m.
If you are thinking in these terms when designing your pattern, here are some equations to help you on your way.
(note that these work for both xspread and yspread, and that the unit of measure for spread_on_paper and distance is the same)
	Eq.1: Finding the amount of spread for a given xspread angle at a given distance:
		spread_on_paper  =  2 * distance * tan(xspread) 
	Eq.2: Finding the distance at which a known spread will occur for a known angle:
		distance = spread_on_paper / (2 * tan(xspread) )
	Eq.3: Finding the angle needed for a known desired spread at a desired range:
		xspread = cot( spread_on_paper / (2 * distance) )
If trying to find out where a pellet would land for a <p> angle specified, just remove to 2 from the equations above.
These only work as expected for  xspread  <  pi/2  and are decreasingly useful as you approach pi/2

Please note that real world spread patterns open up in a non-linear manner.  That is to say, the flight path of real shotgun pellets more closely resembles a funnel than a cone.
The methods used here are strickly conical, which is fine for the purposes of a game.

Also  note that the JA2 game engine sends bullets in a flat trajectory as if they were fired in zero gravity.
So there is no bullet drop or pellet drop at any time in the game, regardless of bullet type.

Please show a sign for positive and negative numbers, and no sign for 0, for pellet angles.
For xspread and yspread, please use positive number and never use a sign.
Please use the decimal format shown. That is, 0.0000
Doing so makes everything a lot easier to read.

		<NAME>ChokeRifledSpread</NAME>
		<DESC>A rifled choke for standard 12ga shotguns.
			This is a little bit of a hack, and a good example of what can be done when getting creative.
			Rifled chokes are intended to increase the range and accuracy of slugs.
			So, the attachment will do so.
			However, rifled chokes also spray out the pellets wildly, making them rather bad for shot.
			They also tend to give shot _less_ range, but we can't accomplish that, so the spread is exaggerated.
			Hopefully, spread will have the desired impact on reducing the usefulness of shot at range.
			(though unskilled characters may find that it inadvertantly increases their chance to hit the target
			with at least one pellet)
