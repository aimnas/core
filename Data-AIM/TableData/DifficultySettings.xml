<!--
		DO NOT CREATE NEW ENTRIES! INSTEAD MODIFY THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL YOU WANT TO PLAY ON!
		There is still hardcoded stuff that will make use of the old 4 difficulty levels.
		
		uiIndex : 0 - 4
		Name : The short name of the difficulty.
		ConfirmText :  The description of the difficulty.
		StartingCash : These are the Starting cash values for the various difficulties. 
		               The only restriction with these, is the INT32 they are stored in. (range is about 2 billion).
					   You can also set negative values here.
		EnemyAPBonus :   Bonus APs for Enemy Soldiers:
						 Number of extra APs for enemy troops at the various difficulty levels.
                         Please note, this number is NOT automatically adjusted based on your selected AP system (25 / 100).
		NumKillsPerProgressPoint : Number of kills required to get a single progress point, based on game difficulty.
								   The total number of progress points you can get is limited by GAME_PROGRESS_KILLS (see JA2Options.ini)
		InitialGarrisonPercentages : Percentage of troops that are actually placed on the map at the start of the game.
									100 = All "default" troops are placed.
									200 = Twice as many troops are placed.
		MinEnemyGroupSize : Minimum enemy group size. Enemy groups will never be smaller than this!
		CounterAttackGroupSize : Counter attacks on cities consist of 4 groups of this size.
		PercentElitesBonus : Percent of troops converted to extra elites in enemy groups
		UnlimitedPoolOfTroops : 0 - false, 1 - true. Determines whether or not the queen has unlimited troops. If she does, most of the settings below are completely ignored.
		QueensInitialPoolOfTroops : Amount of troops available to the queen at game start
		QueenPoolIncrementPerDifficultyLevel : Amount of troops that will be added to queens army when the troops pool is empty
		EnemyStartingAlertLevel : Sets the starting alert chances.
		EnemyAlertDecay : When an enemy spots and chases a player group, the alertness value decrements by this value. Ranges from 1-100 (but recommend 20-60).
		NumAwareBattles : Certain conditions can cause the queen to go into a "full alert" mode. 
			              This means that temporarily, the queen's forces will automatically succeed adjacent checks until x number of enemy-initiated battles occur.  
						  The same variable is what is used to determine the free checks.
		BaseDelayInMinutesBetweenEvaluations : The base interval between the queen's decisions. She can only make one decision at a time.
		EvaluationDelayVariance : A random variation to the interval between queen's decisions.
		GracePeriodInHoursAfterSectorLiberation : This is a delay between the player taking a sector, and the queen being able to decide to attack it.
												  A longer grace period makes the game easier by giving the player more time to prepare for counter-attacks.
		GracePeriodInDaysAfterPatrolDestroyed : This is a delay between the player destroying an enemy patrol, and the queen being able to refill that patrol.
											    A longer grace period causes defeated enemy patrols to reappear less often.
		AggressiveQueenAi : 0 - false 1 - true. Determines whether the queen always prefers attacking your sectors to defending her own.
							JA2 default is FALSE. To ensure she doesn't run out of troops, make sure you either increase the reinforcement pool or enable unlimited reinforcements. 
							
		MaxMercDeaths : How many mercs can die at each difficulty level? min = 0 max = 10
		LootStatusModifier : When opponents drop their equipment on death it gets damaged by this random amount. Usually the higher the difficulty level the higher the possible damage. : 0 - 100
		
	    {Creatures Settings}
		
		CreatureSpreadTime : This is how often the creatures spread, once the quest begins. The smaller the gap, the faster the creatures will advance.
							 This is also directly related to the reproduction rates which are applied each time the creatures spread. (in mins, 5 - 14400)
		QueenReproductionBase : This is how many creatures the queen produces for each cycle of spreading. The higher the numbers the faster the creatures will advance. (1 - 30)
		QueenReproductionBonus : Random bonus for each cycle of spreading. (0 - 10)
		QueenInitBonusSpread : Once the queen is added to the game, we can instantly let her spread x number of times to give her a head start. 
							   This can also be a useful tool for having slow reproduction rates but quicker head start to compensate to make the creatures less aggressive overall. (1 - 10)
		CreaturePopulationModifier : This value modifies the chance to populate a given sector. This is different from the previous definition.
									 This value gets applied to a potentially complicated formula, using the creature habitat to modify chance to populate, along with factoring in the relative distance to the hive range (to promote deeper lair population increases), etc. 
									 Would recommend not tweaking the value too much in either direction from zero due to the fact that this can greatly effect spread times and maximum populations. 
									 Basically, if the creatures are spreading too quickly, increase the value, otherwise decrease it to a negative value. (-5 to 5)
		CreatureTownAggressiveness : Augments the chance that the creatures will attack a town. The conditions for attacking a town are based strictly on the occupation of the creatures in each of the four mine exits. 
									 For each creature there is a base chance of 10% that the creatures will feed sometime during the night. (-100 to 100)
		
		{Underground sectors}
		
		These parameters are used only if in the folder the "Data\Scripts" and "Data-1.13\Scripts" or in the different folder (OtherMod\Scripts\), there is no file initunderground.lua.
		
		SectorJ9B1NumTroops : Enemy soldiers quantity.
		SectorJ9B2NumCreatures : The value is counted according to the formula : 2 + SectorJ9B2NumCreatures*2 + Random( 2 )
		SectorK4B1NumTroops : The value is counted according to the formula : 6 + SectorK4B1NumTroops*2 + Random( 3 )
		SectorK4B1NumElites : The value is counted according to the formula : 4 + SectorK4B1NumElites + Random( 2 )
		SectorO3B1NumTroops : The value is counted according to the formula : 6 + SectorO3B1NumTroops*2 + Random( 3 )
		SectorO3B1NumElites : The value is counted according to the formula : 4 + SectorO3B1NumElites + Random( 2 )
		SectorP3B1NumElites : The value is counted according to the formula : SectorP3B1NumElites + Random( 6 )
		
		{Strategic Other}
		
		StrategicAiActionWakeQueen : When first fight finished, wake up queen ? 0- false 1 - true
		UpdateLastDayOfPlayerActivity : How many days ago does the player check he was active in the captured sector ?
		ChanceOfEnemyAmbushes : modifies the percentage chance of our mercs to be ambushed
		AllowReinforcements : The enemy can send reinforcement to the sector. 0- false 1 - true
		AllowReinforcementsOmerta : Can the enemy send reinforcement to Omerta. 0- false 1 - true
		PopulationLevel2 : Additional troops 2 sectors away from Meduna? 0 - false, 1 - true
		PopulationLevel3 : Additional troops 3 sectors away from Meduna? 0 - false, 1 - true
		
		{Weapon Cache Troops}
		
		Look to the file Mod_Settings.ini.
		
		WeaponCacheTroops1 : The value is counted according to the formula : 6 + WeaponCacheTroops1 * 2
		WeaponCacheTroops2 : The value is counted according to the formula : 6 + WeaponCacheTroops2 * 2
		WeaponCacheTroops3 : The value is counted according to the formula : 6 + WeaponCacheTroops3 * 2
		WeaponCacheTroops4 : The value is counted according to the formula : 6 + WeaponCacheTroops4 * 2
		WeaponCacheTroops5 : The value is counted according to the formula : 6 + WeaponCacheTroops5 * 2
		
		{Strategic Other}
		
		UpgradeAdminsToTroops : Can the AI upgrade all administrators in moving enemy groups? : 0 - false, 1 - true
		UpgradeGarrisonsAdminsToTroops :  Can the AI upgrade all administrators in garrisons? : 0 - false, 1 - true
		AlwaysUpGradeAdminsToTroopsProgress : If highest player progress is higher than this, all admins can be upgraded regardless of UpgradeAdminsToTroops or UpgradeGarrisonsAdminsToTroops
								Valid values from 0 to 100
		LevelModifierLowLimit : Allows to have more variance for combatant levels instead of the fixed map and progress defined levels. This modifier allows to have random LOWER levels. Values from 0 to 5
		LevelModifierHighLimit : Allows to have more variance for combatant levels instead of the fixed map and progress defined levels. This modifier allows to have HIGHER random levels. Values from 0 to 5
								Examples: When both limits are zero you get the original unmodified behaviour.
										  When both limits are set to 3 a combatant that would usually be level 5 could randomly roll anything between level 2 and 8.
										  When low limit is 0 and high limit is 4 that level 5 combatant could roll anything between level 5 and 9 making the game harder.
		AllowUnrestrictedXPLevels : Usually the game limits the maximum XP level for combatants per difficulty level to 6 (Novice), 7 (Experienced) or 8 (Expert). "Insane" has no limit.
									This setting allows to override this limiter and have combatants of up to level 10 in easier difficulty modes. 0 - false, 1 - true
		QueenAttackLosingControlOfSector : Usually queen will stop attacking town sector that has been retaken by player x number of times.
											x = 4 (Novice), 8 (Experienced), 12 (Expert) and 16 (Insane). Set this parameter to 1 to allow unlimited attacks of the queens troops.
		BloodcatAmbushSectors : ? : 0 - false, 1 - true
		AirRaidLookForDive : ? : 0 - false, 1 - true
		
		NumberOfTurnsPowerGenFanWillBeStoppedFor : Used only at UB.
		
		RadioSightings : Alerted soldier calls in help through the radio.
		RadioSightings2 : All enemy individuals call in help through the radio.
		EnemyMoraleWorried : enemy morale cannot go below worried. 0 - false, 1 - true
		MaxMortarsPerTeam : maximum amount of AI soldiers per team (both enemy and militia) spawning with a mortar
