# AIMNAS

AIMNAS is an item/map modification for JA2 1.13, more info on the 1.13 mod can be found at http://ja2v113.pbworks.com

#### Requirements
AIMNAS currently requires atleast version **8790** of JA2 1.13 with gamedir atleast at level **2529**  
Any earlier release of 1.13 may not work correctly with AIMNAS

#### JA2 1.13 download
There are two separate releases of JA2 1.13, the legacy 7609 release and the constantly updated SVN release.
AIMNAS only works with the SVN release, more information about this release can be found on the Bear's Pit forums at http://thepit.ja-galaxy-forum.com/
